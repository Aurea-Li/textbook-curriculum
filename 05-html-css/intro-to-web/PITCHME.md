# Intro to the web

## ðŸ“š Learning Goals ðŸ“š
- Differentiate between a static and dynamic website
- Differentiate between the front-end and the back-end of a web application
- Understand relationship between clients and servers
- Be aware of web standards & browser compatibility

---

## Context Shift
- No more making CLI programs
- Think about writing tests... later
- We'll be able to apply POODR and OO design... later
- Think about making web apps that users interact with

## Static websites vs Dynamic web apps

### Static
Same content to every visitor

### Dynamic
Sites that require user accounts, provide preferences/settings per user, use logic

What makes these sites static or dynamic?

## Front-end vs Back-end

Front-end
- client-side
- what the user interacts with (what they see, hear, and feel, and what they click on)

Back-end
- server-side
- the application logic
- utilizes working with a database

Full-stack
- is familiar with both
- you!

The line between front-end and back-end web development is blurring more every year

## How the Internet Works

- Files need to be stored on a computer somewhere called the [web server](https://www.cloudyn.com/blog/10-facts-didnt-know-server-farms/)
- Uses a protocol called HTTP to receive requests from a _client_

### HTTP Response and Request

## Browsers

- Sir Tim Berners Lee made the first [web page](http://info.cern.ch/) in 1991
- We'll be learning HTML5 and CSS3
- Not totally compatible with computers 2001 or older

---

## Compatibility between browsers
- Safari, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, etc.
- browsers translate code differently
- Choose to focus using Chrome

---

## Conclusion

This week we are:
- creating static sites with HTML and CSS
- Websites available online are stored on a web server
